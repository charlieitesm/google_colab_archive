most of the projects would fail. The model doesn't expect any of the projects in the *live* category to be canceled.\n","\n","Interestingly, both models kept relatively the same failed/successful ratio which again confirms their similarity as seen during the validation and test phases.\n","\n","|State|MLP|Decision Tree|\n","|:---|---:|---:|\n","|Failed|2297|2283|\n","|Successful|502|516|\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"H_C-AIpPkw6h"},"source":["# Final Conclusions\n","\n","As with any Data Science project, EDA and data treatment is essential to a good model. Data is everything, no matter how great the hyperparamentes for the model are, the model will output garbage if it is fed garbage.\n","\n","In this particular case we had to:\n","\n","1. Choose to use the USD variant of the columns in order to be able to compare apples to apples and dropped the original pledged and goal columns\n","1. Do feature engineering and create a new column called *campaign_duration_days* out of the deadline and launched columns.\n","1. Use the name column and apply tokenization to get the top 50 most common tokens which proved to be useful on models such as the MLP Neural Network and decision trees.\n","1. Do a proper treatment of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR)\n","1. Do data scaling and normalization so that numerical columns had similar values and didn't skew the model too much.\n","\n","We also noticed that the *backers* and *usd_pledge_real* data correlate better to the dependen variable *state* and this was confirmed in the validation, test and live datasets. We can see that, in general, if a project has less backers or is further away from the goal, the highest the probability that the project will fail.\n","\n","Naive Bayes, SVM had the worst performance out of all models and logistic regression didn't do too bad.\n","\n","We got the best results with MLP Neural Networks, Decision Tree and Random Forest. We had 94% accuracy in these models, however, we had less-than ideal F1-Scores which takes into account the precision and recall of the model. This is the reason why using accuracy as the only metric can be misleading, we needed to pay attention to why we were getting such low F1-Scores.\n","\n","We found that the undefined, suspended and live projects were underrepresented and that they were hardly classified by any model. But we decided that undefined projects didn't have relevant data so we could remove them from training; the suspended projects could arguably be grouped with the canceled projects. And most importantly, the live projects could be used as real-world data to use our best model with.\n","\n","After factorizing these columns, we could confirm that the models still had a 94% accuracy but a much better F1-Score of 0.89-0.94 for macro and weighted scores. Which tells us that the model is more confident about the kind of predictions it is making.\n","\n","The best models were Decision Tree and MLP Neural Networks, chosen both because of their performance on the validation set, the relative ease of configuration and less amount of training time.\n","\n","It's worth noting that while Decision Trees work really good on this kind of problems, they have trouble performing well extrapolating to data that was not seen during training, columns that contain time series such as dates are a good example of this.\n","\n","MLP Neural Networks, on the other hand, are better at extrapolating data that was not seen during training, which for this particular problem is probable that will happen with projects that have periods of time that are bigger than the ones seen during training.\n","\n","Given these reasons, MLP Neural Network would probably be a better fit to continuosly make predictions on new data from crowdfunding projects.\n","\n","Finally, the data shows that Product design, tabletop games and gadgets are the type of projects that have a better chance to succeed on Kickstarter. Paradoxically, product design is also one of the categories that usually fail along with fashion apparel and apps. The fact that product design appears in both categories might be due to it being the biggest category in the platform.\n","\n","The amount of days of a campaign, the number of backers and how far the pledged money is from the goal seem to be better factors at predicting the final state of a campaing, which confirms what was seen in the correlation matrix."]}]}
