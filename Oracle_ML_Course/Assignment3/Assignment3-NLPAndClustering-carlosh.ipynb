You will build a clustering algorithm that finds similar topics across documents - this is called topic modelling.\n","\n","An algorithm does not work with text directly but needs to translate it to numbers first. This is typically done by so called TF-IDF transformation. Sometimes you already know classes to which documents belong. Think of an email as a document and spam or non-spam as classes. In that case, you can build a nice Naive Bayes model on top of a TF-IDF matrix. However, in this project we will focus on the unsupervised situation when the classes are not known and they need to be discovered via clustering. Clustering here can be done via the matrix factorisation technique NMF - [see this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-articles-with-nmf-8c6b2a227a45) for more details. The task of the project is to discover topics of department of justice press releases.\n","\n","### Time required\n","4 weeks\t\n","\n","### Data\n","https://www.kaggle.com/jbencina/department-of-justice-20092018-press-releases/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dI7Bj3WCvJZZ"},"source":["# Resources - DELETE ME!\n","\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-articles-with-nmf-8c6b2a227a45\n","\n","How NMF actually works\n","https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/topic-modeling-with-nmf-for-user-reviews-classification-65913d0b44fe\n","\n","# Questions\n","\n","1.
